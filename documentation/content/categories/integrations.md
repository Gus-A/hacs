Hassio already includes many integrations. For a full list see [this link](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/).  
Furthermore, there are many integrations adding additional sensors for every kind of device build by the community. With this integrations you can add new features or data points to your hassio installation.  

After installing a custom integration via HACS it is stored in your `config/custom_components` directory, each integration in a seperate folder.
