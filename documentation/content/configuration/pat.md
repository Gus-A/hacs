The token generated below will only have read-only access to public information.

Why does HACS need this? The GitHub API lets HACS do 60 calls an hour without an access token, with a token HACS gets 5000 calls an hour.

## Step 1 - Open browser

_You are probably looking at this in a browser, so we can probably check this off._

## Step 2 - Go to your GitHub "Developer settings"

_And then "Personal access tokens."_
or click here: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)


## Step 3 - Start generation

Click the "Generate new token" button.

## Step 4 - Choices

First give it a logical name so that you can recognize it.

Then click the "Generate token" button at the bottom.

You **do not** need to check _any_ of the boxes.

Now you see the generated token, this will be the **only** time you see it, make sure that you copy it manually or by clicking the clipboard icon.
